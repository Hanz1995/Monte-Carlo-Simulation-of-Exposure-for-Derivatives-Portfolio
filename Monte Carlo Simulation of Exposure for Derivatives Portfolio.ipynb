    "# 1. Introduction and Regulatory Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presents a Monte Carlo simulation framework for estimating counterparty credit exposure in a simplified derivatives portfolio. Specifically, we simulate the exposure profiles of two uncollateralized instruments—an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) and a Foreign Exchange Forward (FX Forward)—to calculate Expected Exposure (EE), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) under regulatory assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Background: Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) refers to the risk that the counterparty to a financial contract may default before the final settlement of cash flows. Unlike traditional credit risk, CCR is **market-dependent**, since the exposure changes over time with the market value of the trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Basel III, banks are required to calculate and report several measures of Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR), including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expected Exposure (EE)**: The average future positive exposure at a specific time horizon, computed across simulated market paths. It serves as the foundational input for regulatory capital calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Potential Future Exposure (PFE)**: A specified quantile (e.g., 95% or 97.5%) of the exposure distribution at each time point, reflecting the level of exposure that is only exceeded in a small percentage of extreme scenarios. PFE is often used to set internal credit limits and monitor tail risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exposure at Default (EAD)**: An estimate of the exposure at the time of counterparty default. Under the Internal Model Method (IMM), EAD is typically computed as a discounted sum of EE values, multiplied by a regulatory factor (e.g., α = 1.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)**: The regulatory capital base for CCR, calculated by applying risk weights to EAD. RWA feeds directly into minimum capital requirement calculations under Basel III.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Simulation Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike static metrics such as current MtM (mark-to-market), the future exposure of derivatives depends on simulated market paths (e.g., interest rates, exchange rates). Monte Carlo simulation is therefore a widely accepted approach for modeling EE and EAD under the **Internal Model Method (IMM)** framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation aligns with practices outlined in:\n",

    "- [SR 11-7: Federal Reserve Guidance on Model Risk Management](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this project are:\n",
    "1. **Simulate market paths** for interest rates and FX rates using simplified stochastic processes.\n",
    "2. **Construct a two-product derivatives portfolio**: an IRS and an FX Forward.\n",
    "3. **Calculate MtM and Exposure** along each simulated path.\n",
    "4. **Aggregate across paths** to compute EE, PFE (optional), and EAD.\n",
    "5. **Estimate regulatory capital** using simplified RWA formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework is modular and extensible: additional instruments, collateral features, or risk factors may be added in future iterations to build a multi-product portfolio-level CCR engine.\n",

    "All instruments are assumed to be **uncollateralized**, meaning there is no exchange of variation margin to offset daily mark-to-market movements. As a result, any positive MtM directly translates into full counterparty credit exposure. In contrast, collateralized trades governed by Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) would reduce or eliminate exposure through margining. The uncollateralized setup reflects a worst-case scenario and simplifies the simulation framework.\n",
